# Airbnb Clone Backend Prototype Outline
## Developing a backend prototype involves identifying key functionalities, designing API endpoints, and sketching out the logic for how these endpoints interact with your database. Based on the SQL tables you've created, here's a prototype outline covering essential features:

## 1. Core Backend Features and Functionalities
## An Airbnb-like platform requires several core backend functionalities:

 ## User Management:

### User Registration:

* Accept user details (first name, last name, email, password, phone number, role).

* Hash passwords securely.

* Store user data in the User table.

* Handle duplicate email errors.

### User Login/Authentication:

* Validate user credentials (email/password).

* Generate secure authentication tokens (e.g., JWT).

* Manage session validity.

### User Profile Management:

* Retrieve user's own profile information.

* Update personal details (e.g., first name, last name, phone number).

* Change password (requires old password validation).

* Handle authorization for profile access (only own profile or admin access).

### Role Management:

* Assign 'guest', 'host', or 'admin' roles during registration.

* Enforce role-based access control for specific API endpoints (e.g., only hosts can list properties).

## Property Management (for Hosts):

### Property Listing Creation:

* Accept property details (name, description, location, price per night, host ID).

* Validate required fields.

* Store new property in the Property table.

* Ensure host authentication and authorization for this action.


### Property Listing Viewing:

* Retrieve all properties (for general search).

* Retrieve specific property details by property_id.

* Retrieve properties owned by a specific host (host_id).

### Property Listing Update:

* Accept updated property details.

* Validate ownership (only the host who listed it or an admin can update).

* Update existing property in the Property table.

### Property Listing Deletion:

* Accept property_id for deletion.

* Validate ownership and ensure no active bookings are associated (or handle cascade deletion/soft delete).

* Remove property from the Property table.

### Property Search and Filtering:

* Filter properties by location.

* Filter by price range.

* Filter by availability dates.

## Booking Management:

### Booking Creation:

* Accept property_id, user_id, start_date, end_date.

* Validate date ranges (start before end, future dates).

* Check property availability for the given dates (no overlapping confirmed/pending bookings).

* Calculate total_price based on price_per_night and number of nights.

* Store booking with initial 'pending' status in the Booking table.

* Ensure guest authentication and correct user_id.

### Booking Viewing:

* Retrieve all bookings for a specific user (either as a guest or as a host).

* Retrieve details of a specific booking by booking_id.

* Filter bookings by status (pending, confirmed, canceled).

### Booking Status Update:

* Allow hosts to confirm or cancel bookings.

* Allow guests to cancel their own bookings (within policy).

* Update status in the Booking table.

* Send notifications upon status change.

### Property Availability Check:

* Provide an endpoint to query a property's available dates or check if a specific date range is available.

## Payment Processing:

### Payment Initiation:

* Accept booking_id, amount, payment_method.

* Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal, Stripe - conceptual for prototype).

* Record payment details (amount, date, method) in the Payment table.

* Update booking status to 'confirmed' if payment is successful.

### Payment Status Recording:

* Store the result of payment gateway transactions.

* Associate payment with a booking_id.

* Payment Details Retrieval:

* Retrieve payment information for a specific booking.

## Review Management:

### Review Submission:

* Accept property_id, user_id, rating, comment.

* Validate rating (1-5).

* Ensure the user has a completed booking for that property.

* Store review in the Review table.

### Review Viewing:

* Retrieve all reviews for a specific property.

* Retrieve all reviews written by a specific user.

* Calculate average rating for a property.

## Messaging:

* Message Sending:

* Accept sender_id, recipient_id, message_body.

* Validate sender and recipient are valid users.

* Store message in the Message table.

### Conversation Viewing:

* Retrieve all messages between two specific users (a conversation).

* Retrieve all conversations for a given user (list of contacts they have messaged).

2. API Design (RESTful Approach)
A RESTful API is a common approach for web services. Here's how some endpoints might look, corresponding to your tables:

Users
POST /api/users/register - Register a new user

POST /api/users/login - Authenticate user, return token

GET /api/users/{user_id} - Get user profile

PUT /api/users/{user_id} - Update user profile

Properties
GET /api/properties - Get all properties (with optional filters like location, price range)

GET /api/properties/{property_id} - Get details of a single property

POST /api/properties - Create a new property listing (requires host authentication)

PUT /api/properties/{property_id} - Update a property listing (requires host authentication and ownership)

DELETE /api/properties/{property_id} - Delete a property listing (requires host authentication and ownership)

Bookings
POST /api/bookings - Create a new booking (requires guest authentication)

GET /api/bookings/user/{user_id} - Get all bookings for a specific user (guest or host perspective)

GET /api/bookings/{booking_id} - Get details of a single booking

PUT /api/bookings/{booking_id}/status - Update booking status (e.g., 'confirmed', 'canceled' by host)

Payments
POST /api/payments - Process a new payment for a booking

GET /api/payments/booking/{booking_id} - Get payment details for a specific booking

Reviews
POST /api/reviews - Submit a review for a property (requires guest authentication and completed booking)

GET /api/properties/{property_id}/reviews - Get all reviews for a property

Messages
POST /api/messages - Send a new message

GET /api/messages/user/{user_id}/conversations - Get all conversations for a user

GET /api/messages/conversation/{conversation_id} - Get messages within a specific conversation

3. Conceptual Backend Logic Examples (Pseudo-code)
Let's look at pseudo-code for a couple of key operations to illustrate the interaction with the database.

Example 1: User Registration
// Endpoint: POST /api/users/register
// Input: JSON body with first_name, last_name, email, password, phone_number, role

FUNCTION register_user(request_body):
    // 1. Validate Input
    IF request_body.email IS INVALID OR request_body.password IS WEAK THEN
        RETURN 400 (Bad Request) - "Invalid input"

    // 2. Hash Password
    hashed_password = HASH_PASSWORD(request_body.password)

    // 3. Store User in Database (using User table)
    TRY:
        EXECUTE SQL:
            INSERT INTO User (first_name, last_name, email, password_hash, phone_number, role, created_at)
            VALUES (request_body.first_name, request_body.last_name, request_body.email, hashed_password, request_body.phone_number, request_body.role, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
        RETURN 201 (Created) - "User registered successfully"
    CATCH DUPLICATE_EMAIL_ERROR:
        RETURN 409 (Conflict) - "Email already exists"
    CATCH OTHER_DB_ERROR:
        RETURN 500 (Internal Server Error) - "Failed to register user"


Example 2: Creating a Booking
// Endpoint: POST /api/bookings
// Input: JSON body with property_id, user_id, start_date, end_date

FUNCTION create_booking(request_body, authenticated_user_id):
    // 1. Validate Input (e.g., dates are valid, start_date < end_date)
    IF request_body.start_date IS INVALID OR request_body.end_date IS INVALID THEN
        RETURN 400 (Bad Request) - "Invalid dates"

    // 2. Verify User ID (ensure booking is made by authenticated user)
    IF request_body.user_id != authenticated_user_id THEN
        RETURN 403 (Forbidden) - "Unauthorized booking creation"

    // 3. Check Property Existence and Availability
    property_details = QUERY_DATABASE:
        SELECT price_per_night FROM Property WHERE property_id = request_body.property_id

    IF property_details IS NULL THEN
        RETURN 404 (Not Found) - "Property not found"

    // Check for overlapping bookings (pseudo-query)
    overlapping_bookings = QUERY_DATABASE:
        SELECT * FROM Booking
        WHERE property_id = request_body.property_id
        AND status IN ('pending', 'confirmed')
        AND (
            (start_date <= request_body.end_date AND end_date >= request_body.start_date)
        )
    IF overlapping_bookings EXIST THEN
        RETURN 409 (Conflict) - "Property not available for these dates"

    // 4. Calculate Total Price
    num_nights = CALCULATE_DAYS(request_body.start_date, request_body.end_date)
    total_price = num_nights * property_details.price_per_night

    // 5. Create Booking in Database (using Booking table)
    booking_uuid = GENERATE_UUID()
    TRY:
        EXECUTE SQL:
            INSERT INTO Booking (booking_id, property_id, user_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status, created_at)
            VALUES (booking_uuid, request_body.property_id, request_body.user_id, request_body.start_date, request_body.end_date, total_price, 'pending', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
        RETURN 201 (Created) - { "message": "Booking created successfully", "booking_id": booking_uuid, "total_price": total_price }
    CATCH DB_ERROR:
        RETURN 500 (Internal Server Error) - "Failed to create booking"


4. Further Considerations for a Prototype
Authentication & Authorization: Implement robust token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC) to secure your APIs.

Error Handling: Provide meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.

Data Validation: Implement server-side validation for all incoming data to ensure integrity and security.

Security: Protect against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc. (using ORMs or prepared statements is crucial).

Scalability: Consider how the backend will handle increased load as the application grows.

Technology Stack: Choose a suitable backend framework (e.g., Python with Flask/Django, Node.js with Express, Ruby on Rails, Go, Java Spring Boot) that aligns with your development preferences and project requirements.
